From our birth, the place and the date is already an important Data that was stored by the goverment, fast forward in life, when we get to the Elementary School, new Data such as test score, presention and other are placed and analyzed everyday. And Not only that, if you use things like social media, each of us will have a new Data almost every second we let the Application active. Anything from your random post, your hate comment, your accident like, your picture and even your location that was analyzed every second is a Data. Even then if you doesn't have a social Media your phone and other devices trasmit Data on nearly every second it existed, even when you doesn't aware of that. &nbsp;</div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">These Data, not only just are a random information that doesn't pose any purpose. Yeah, it is true that for some people the Data such as your post or location pose no purpose, but for some other, like the departement store you bought your shoes from, the Cinema near your university, or the Criminals that stalks you at night those Data could be just as precious as gold. Believe it or not those Data could be used to accurately predict the future. For the Departement Store, the Data they gained can be used to predict the perfect location for they new branch, for the Cinema, it could be used to arrange The Next Day Movie Schedule properly, and For the Criminals, The Data could be used to predict where are you this night, tommorow and the perfect time and place to rob or kidnap you.  &nbsp;</div>

                    <li> <b>School Counceling Class </b> 
                    	<p>Data were already used to determine the action of the School Counceling Class. In The past, we usually used an untested theory to determine the future of a child/students in a school. And even then it was rarely used because of it's extremely inaccurate. Now, however a lot of School already use the Big Data Technology to predict student progress or in other word "Predict the student future".</p>
</li><li><b>Weather</b>
	<p>Have you ever seen the weather forecast in your Television or Radio. These actually was a prediction of the future and this also made by Data which was collected using some other technology advancement called as The IoT Sensors. This Sensors were so small and advanced that most smartphone have these sensors by themselves. Each of these sensors that was spread over the region were analyzed to predict the most accurate weather prediction. This Predictions believe it or not were 95% Accurate for prediction the span of 1 Day, 80% for the span of 5 day and continously decreasing over time. </p>

</li><li><b>Stock Market</b>
	<p>Stock Market is a pretty big Economy sector nowadays, and if we can predict the next state of the Market, we could get a good amount of money. This had been used by a lot of people and company which used Datas to predict it. A lot of algorithm had been developed to crack the algorithm, and there's actually some calculation algorithm that have a great accuracy until 65% but most of them were still not that accurate. However with the increasing technology Advancement, especially in Data related tech, thee algorithm could improve to even a more accurate level.</p>
